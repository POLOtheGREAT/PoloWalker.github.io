    <p>I wanna thank you for coming by! There isn't a whole lot here yet, but, needn't you worry. 
        Soon it'll be bustling with all the cool stuff that I'll be learning in my new coding program. 
        Hey and guess what?! You can create a cool space or page for your ideas as well and I'm going 
        to tell you how!  </p>
        <p>First, you're going to go to Github.com and sign up for your free account by creating a username 
            and password. Once you're in, you're going to click to create a new repository. Please make sure 
            this particular repository is "public". The name of this repository will be the same as your 
            username, dot github, dot io. Like so: "username.github.io". You'll now click on "uploading an 
            existing file" and we're going to do just that once we create or find the files we want. On your 
            computer you want to create a folder for this repository and in this folder we're going to add a 
            couple things. Using the terminal, you'll create a file named "index.html" and in this file you're 
            going to introduce yourself, and also add an image source tag. Save this to the folder your created. 
            Also, you want to add that pic you eluded to (the one showing your good side, right?!) to the folder 
            as well. Now, you want to drag and drop both of these files to that "upload..." box we opened on 
            github.com. Click "Commit changes". Lastly, dial up your repository in a new window and Voila! A 
            child is born!
        </p>
